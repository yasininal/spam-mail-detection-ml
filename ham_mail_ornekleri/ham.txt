Hey, are we still on for dinner tonight? Let me know so I can make a reservation.

I'm stuck in traffic, I might be 10 minutes late. Sorry!

Did you finish the project report? I need to review it before the meeting tomorrow.

Can you buy some milk and bread on your way home? Thanks, love you.

What time does the movie start? I am leaving the house now.
